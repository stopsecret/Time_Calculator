Time_Calculator
===============

A Python calculator that returns the time between two times. This is useful for seeing how long you've worked.

An example of how to use this is if you were on the computer from 4:00 AM to 3:40 PM.

1. Open the calculator, and specify your start time

2. Specify the end time


The calculator will come up with how long you have been on in hours and minutes.
Please note that if you were to be on from 4:00 AM to 4:45 PM, since this calculator does not work in AM and PM, it would state you've been on for 45 minutes. Some hour adding might be neccesary for very long periods of time.
